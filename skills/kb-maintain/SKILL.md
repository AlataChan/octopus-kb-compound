# KB Maintain

## Overview

Maintain the wiki as a living artifact. Every change should improve structure, evidence quality, and graph navigability at the same time.

## Workflow

1. Read the schema before changing pages.
2. Inspect the index and affected concept pages.
3. Ingest the new source or maintenance request.
4. Plan impacted pages before editing.
5. Update frontmatter, summaries, wikilinks, and index/log entries together.
6. Run lint to catch broken links, orphans, and missing metadata.

When available, use `octopus_kb_compound.planner.plan_maintenance()` or the `plan-maintenance` CLI command before editing pages. Treat the plan as guidance; it should not mutate the vault by itself.

## Rules

- Never edit raw-source files beyond frontmatter normalization unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer updating existing concept pages over creating duplicates.
- Add wikilinks only when the target page is canonical and useful.
- Avoid overlinking. A dense graph is not automatically a useful graph.
- If a concept deserves a page but does not exist, create a stub or record the gap explicitly.

## Maintenance Output

- changed pages
- new pages
- new or removed wikilinks
- metadata changes
- lint findings and follow-up actions

See `references/maintenance-checklist.md` when you need the compact update checklist.
